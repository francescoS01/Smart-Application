Milestone 3
For short if you need to start the docker use the command 
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
from inside the folder assuming you have docker installed if not please install it.

the documentation of the APIs when the docker is up and running is available at localhost:8000/docs through the web browser.

For the documentation please open the [./doc/html/index.html](./doc/html/index.html) on your local browser or use the pdf inside the doc folder in case of compatibility issues.
