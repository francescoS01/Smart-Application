The alert monitor has the responsibility of checking kpi expressions e.\+g. "{}sum(cycles)"{}, it knows which are the kpis to monitor and does so by interacting with the kpi engine to calculate alert expressions. The way it works is that it does polling on a defined time-\/interval using the following informations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the machine for which the values are to be calculated.
\item the expression used.
\item the sliding window size i.\+e. how far back from the time it was polling it has to take data from.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The actual calculation is done by the kpi engine, the alert monitor uses the time range determined by the sliding window size and asks the kpi engine to calculate a boolean expression, if it evaluates to true then it has to contact the api layer and notify it that an alert has been fired giving the necessary informations. ~\newline


Also the alert monitor holds information about which expression are to be monitored.
